# Machine learning algorithms for data science

### 1. MNIST GAN

Generate hand-written digits with a Generative Adversarial Network train on the MNIST dataset.
Modification of latent vectors to observe the impact on generated digits.


### 2. Linear SVM, Kernel SVM and RFF

Use of Support Vector Machines for a classification task on MNIST data. First tests done on a reduce number of entries with Linear and Kernel (Gaussian) SVM.
Introduction of Random Fourier Features and the "kernel trick" to reduce the computational time required for larger dataset.


### 3. Diffusion models for images

Implementation of a diffusion model to generate images following a given prompt.
Generation of optic illusions under geometrical transformations.
